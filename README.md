### **Project README (`README.md`)**

```markdown
# Palace of Goods

## Overview

**Palace of Goods** is a Web3-powered marketplace built using **Flask** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **Pi Network** for cryptocurrency payments and user authentication.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: Pi Network SDK (Pi Payments)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

### Setup Instructions

#### **1. Backend Setup**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Create a `.env` file and configure your environment variables:
    ```env
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    DATABASE_URI=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
    ```
4. Run the Flask app:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

#### **2. Frontend Setup**

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
2. Make sure you have Pi SDK integrated by including it in `public/index.html`:
    ```html
    <script src="https://sdk.minepi.com/pi-sdk.js"></script>
    <script>
      Pi.init({ version: "2.0", sandbox: true });
    </script>
    ```
3. Start the React app:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

#### **3. Running with Docker**

1. Set up Docker to run both the frontend and backend services.

2. **Backend Dockerfile**:
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM python:3.9-slim

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

    COPY . .

    CMD ["python", "main.py"]
    ```

3. **Frontend Dockerfile**:
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM node:18-alpine

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install

    COPY . .

    CMD ["npm", "start"]
    ```

4. **Docker Compose**:

    In the root directory, create `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      backend:
        build: ./backend
        ports:
          - "5000:5000"
      frontend:
        build: ./frontend
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
    ```

5. To start the application:
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can:

- Register and log in users through the `/auth/register` and `/auth/login` API endpoints.
- View products, add new ones, and purchase them using Pi Network payments on the frontend.
- View product details and initiate payments through Pi's SDK.

## Future Improvements

- **Cross-chain Payment Support**: Implement payments across multiple networks (Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.) in addition to Pi Network.
- **User Profile**: Allow users to create profiles, manage their purchases, and track their transaction history.
- **Product Reviews and Ratings**: Implement functionality for users to rate and review products.
